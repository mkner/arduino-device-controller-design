### Low level controller design for devices and robots using arduino microcontroller 

These projects are based on the course 
Building robots and other devices with Arduino 
(Строим роботов и другие устройства на Arduino)
that is available online from the Moscow Physics and Technical Instutute
(МФТИ - Московский физико-технический институт)


The course provides engaging and often brilliant lectures but minimal or missing documentation, diagrams, schematics,
spec sheets, etc. So the major challange was to create the projects from practically from ground up based on 
the general presentations in the lectures. Part lists had to be put together, the parts ordered, sorted, catagorized, and tested
and spec sheets for the components located. 
This included finding the best equivalents to the Amperka Troyka boards and modules that were highlighted in the course 
that are not readily available. And schematics and board layouts put had to be put together and then
jetisoned for a more ideal solution with the actual physical layout, wiring, testing for 
the components that would be the best fit for the ones utilized in the projects as presented in the
lectures.

What a great example of what is not unusual in real world engineering in industry.

The software is basically coded up from scratch to match the ad hoc nature of assembly and 
testing of the projects. The main control loop for the various devices and their interactions is in C++
and utilizes libraries specific to the Arduinio boards.

This is an ongoing project and the eventual goal is to build a custom differential drive autonomous robot
to implement and use as a test-bed for the software engineering side for autonomous vehicle and robotic
systems that I have done a lot of work with over the last several years.
